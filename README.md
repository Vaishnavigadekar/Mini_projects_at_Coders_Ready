# Mini_Projects:
I Learned the process of Exploratory Data Analysis while working on all the below mentioned projects.I tried to execute all the basic knowledge and concepts while executing the code.I'm uploading all my mini projects over here do check and share your valuable feedback.

# Mini_Project_01:
## Generating data with Noise,plotiing Single file data with best fit curves and multiple file handling.
objective :
   - Generating random data with Noise.
   - Used Gaussian curve Fitting Function.
   - Perform Multiple File Handling and its Visualization.
   - Plotting text file data with lognormal fitting curves.
   - Multiple file Handling.
   
 Conclusion:
 
   - here we used curve_fit function from the python library knwon as scipy.
   - Curve fitting examines the relationship between one or more predictors(independent variables) and a response variable (dependent variable),with a goal of     defining a "best fit" model of relationship.
   - Curve fitting involves first defining mapping function(basis function or objective function),then searching for the parameters to the function that results in the minimum error.
   - We use for loop for mutiple file handling. Alos we used "for loop" for sorting and arranging data in order and avoid scatterness of the plot.
- Adding titles, labels and legends in the plot makes the plot more attractive and presentable.

# Mini_Project_02: 
## Plotting Covid_19 cases and deaths by states with best fit curve
objective: Exploratory Data Analysis on Covid_19 data.
  - To analyze the impacts of covid-19 on the economy of world and lives of people.
  - Performed various steps such as data extraction,data cleaining and plotting for better accuracy and visualization.
  
 Conclusion:
 
  - Used exponential function of numpy.random for creating a random data.
  -  libraries such as pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn are used.

# Mini_Project_03:
## EDA on Data set of Hotel Booking
objective:
  - Objective of the Project is to check favorable month ,time, date, day and place people like to choose the
most while making booking for the hotels.

Conclusion:

  - We can see that there two categories of hotel prefered by Customers they are "city hotels" and " Resort Hotels".
  - After doing EDA we see that most Prefered hotel are the 'city hotels'.
  - August,July,may,October and April had highest number of bookings ,reason behind this could be the summer vacations or festival holidays.
  - Average costomers mainly prefer "Resort Hotels" for Weekened night stays than "City Hotels".
  
  # Mini_project_04:
  ## EDA on Data of Titanic Survivors.
  Objective:
   - Objective of this project is to predict a clssification , survival and deaths in particular incident.
   - Analyzing data set on basis of Passenger survived , passenger class , Passenger Name ,
Sex, Age, Sibling and spouse , parch is total count of parents and children and Ticket information. from
this data we have to predict whether passenger has survived or not.

Conclusion:
   - More passenger survived who were travelling alone than those travelling with friends or family.
   - We can observe that maximum females survived from the accident. This may be because, we have seen that, women and children were given first preference to board the safety boats.
   - Maximum passengers who survived are traveling in 1st Class females while the least are 3rd class males.
